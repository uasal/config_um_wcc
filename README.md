# config_um_wcc

UM WCC-specific repository for support data and configuration management as an installable python package. 

Details on the Configuration Management Plan for these repos can be found in the [UASAL Development Guide](https://uasal.github.io/uasal_development_guide/python/configuration_management.html).

The parameters for each subsystem are found in the `configs` directory, and supporting data is found in the `support_data` directory.
A description of how configurations are used in UASAL software, users can find an example notebook in the `docs` directory of the  [config_project_template](https://github.com/uasal/config_project_template) repository. 

## Dependencies and Requirements

`config_um_wcc` is dependent on [utils_config](https://github.com/uasal/utils_config) but will automatically be installed via 
```sh 
pip install git+https://github.com/uasal/config_um_wcc.git
```

## Pip Installation

```sh
pip install git+https://github.com/uasal/config_um_wcc.git
```

## Git Clone Installation

### **1. Clone the Repository**
```sh
git clone https://github.com/uasal/config_um_wcc.git
cd config_um_wcc
```

### **2. Install the Package**
```sh
pip install .
```

> [!Note]
> To install package with optional dependencies *(ex. pytest)*, run the following pip command instead:<br>
> 
> `pip install '.[dev]'`<br>
> **OR**<br>
> `pip install ".[dev]"`
>
> Pytests will be able to be used when installing `config_um_wcc` with the `.[dev]` command.

## Usage

config_um_wcc makes usage of the ConfigLoader class (as *config_loader*) from utils_config via the `load_config_values` method, accepting 'raw' 'parsed' or 'unitless' as an argument, returning a dictionary after parsing the 'configs' directory for .toml files
```python
import config_um_wcc
data = config_um_wcc.load_config_values()
```

load_config_values() has a default argument of 'raw' but alternatively accepts 3 arguments that trigger data to be formatted differently: 
- `load_config_values('unitless')` -> 0.01
- `load_config_values('parsed')` -> {'value': 0.01, 'unit': 'arcsecond'}
- `load_config_values('raw')` -> 10e-3arcsecond

For importing data and keeping code consistent across installs, config_um_wcc will return the path to support_data with `get_data_path()`
```python
import config_um_wcc
data_path = config_um_wcc.get_data_path()
print(data_path)
``` 

## Astropy Unit Validation

All .toml config values should have a valid astropy unit if any units are defined. If no unit is included, the value is assumed to be unitless. A GitHub CI will automatically run a test on push to validate astropy units in the configs, reporting any issues with non-conforming astropy units. If you'd like to perform validation locally, you may run `pytest tests/test_configs.py` from the root directory of the repo. Alternatively in your python environment you may run the following snippet:
```python
import config_um_wcc
config_um_wcc.load_config_values("parsed", return_loader=True).validate_astropy()
```
Which will return 'True' if every unit is a valid astropy unit, or a list containing every invalid unit. If you would like to use a custom u
nit, click [here](https://docs.astropy.org/en/stable/units/combining_and_defining.html#defining-units) for how to define that as a custom unit in Astropy.
  

## Git large file storage (LFS)

This repository makes use of the git large file storage for files listed in the `.gitattributes` file.
Accessing these files will require users having (Git Large File Storage (LFS))[https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/managing-large-files/installing-git-large-file-storage] installed on their local machine.

If you have Git LFS installed, then the large files will be pulled by default.
This can be disabled in your gitconfig, as described (at this link)[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42019529/how-to-clone-pull-a-git-repository-ignoring-lfs].
